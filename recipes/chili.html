<h3>Chili is a staple comfort food, and for very good reason.</h3>
<h3>Itâ€™s hearty, filling, and its uses go way beyond being a simple weeknight dinner.</h3>

<h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 large white onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp. chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. paprika</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
        Kosher salt
        Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (15-oz.) can kidney beans, drained
        Shredded cheddar, sour cream, and sliced scallions, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Method:</em></h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
<li>Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. </li>
<li>Add tomato paste, stirring to coat vegetables.</li>
<li>Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Drain any excess fat.</li>
<li>Add chili powder, oregano, cumin, paprika, and cayenne (if using); generously season with salt and black pepper. Pour in tomatoes and beans and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded and liquid is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes; season with salt and black pepper, if needed.</li>
